            <p class="txt">
                As a current Lambda School student, everything we do to learn or practice is done online through the use of Zoom, Slack, the Dashboard and the Training Kit. We can easily access Zoom and Slack through any mobile device but what about the Dashboard and Training Kit?
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
                Currently, the only way to access it is over a web browser, but when you are on a mobile web browser it's obvious it wasn't built with responsiveness in mind. Talking to students every day, they all seem to share the same major concern with how inaccessible the Lambda School dashboard is.

                Our main goal was to create four of the major screens for this mobile app while using the google sprint design process.

                    Initially it felt uncomfortable to start a sprint process off with the short amount of research we had gathered but we felt it would be more beneficial to focus on solving our main problem as quickly as possible. We took a lot of inference into the main problem from our own problems with the web version of the dashboard. This was our ideal problem statement:
